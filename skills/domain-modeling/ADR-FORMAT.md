# ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc. Create the directory lazily — only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why* — not in filling out sections.

## Optional sections

Only include these when they add genuine value. Most ADRs won't need them.

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`) — useful when decisions are revisited
- **Considered Options** — only when the rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences** — only when non-obvious downstream effects need to be called out

## Numbering

Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## When to offer an ADR

All three must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder "why on earth did they do it this way?"
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and you picked one for specific reasons

Skip it otherwise: reversible decisions get reversed anyway, unsurprising ones raise no questions, and "we did the obvious thing" isn't worth recording.

### What qualifies

- **Architectural shape** — e.g. "monorepo," "event-sourced write model, projected read model."
- **Integration patterns between contexts** — e.g. "Ordering and Billing talk via domain events, not synchronous HTTP."
- **Technology choices that carry lock-in** — database, message bus, auth provider, deployment target. Not every library, just the ones that would take a quarter to swap.
- **Boundary and scope decisions** — e.g. "Customer data is owned by the Customer context; others reference it by ID only." The explicit no's are as valuable as the yes's.
- **Deliberate deviations from the obvious path** — e.g. "manual SQL instead of an ORM, because X." Anything a reasonable reader would assume was done differently — these stop the next engineer "fixing" something deliberate.
- **Constraints not visible in the code** — e.g. "can't use AWS, compliance." "Response times under 200ms, partner API contract."
- **Rejected alternatives when non-obvious** — if you considered GraphQL and picked REST for subtle reasons, record it, or someone will suggest GraphQL again in six months.
